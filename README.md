## Setup for Development

You can run a [hosted copy](https://webdev.dartlang.org/examples/quickstart) of this
sample. Or run your own copy:

1. Create a local copy of this repo (use the "Clone or download" button above).
2. Get the dependencies: `pub get`
3. Launch a development server: `pub serve`
4. In a browser, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
